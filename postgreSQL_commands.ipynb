    "## 3- UPDATE vs CASE:\n",

    "## 5- TRUNCATE VS DELETE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE statement is typically far more efficient than using the DELETE statement with no WHERE clause to empty the table\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE requires fewer resources and less logging overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating table each time try to use truncate as it will keep the table structure and properties intact\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncate frees up space and impossible to rollback. Example: suppose you have 100 queries and the query 90 is TRUNCATE. If you get an error at query 95. What SQL do at such time is that it rollbacks all your tables to its initial stage. But if there is a TRUNCATE statement in between it will not be able to rollback to the initial stage and you will lose your data of that particular table. Because TRUNCATE is doing hard delete\n",
